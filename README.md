# The Big K First Iteration Website
This was a work in progress website for a client opening a hostel in Indonesia. 

This first iteration was scraped after the projects requirements changed.

The design document is provided as a jpeg named Website_Mockup. Design of this website was not completed by myself.

A live example of this site can be found at: http://the-big-k.herokuapp.com/
