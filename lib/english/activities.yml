Finding Nemo: There are 27 islands and countless reefs that make up the Karimunjawa archipelago. The boat trips can take you to any of of these unique locations. Usually, you’ll visit two reefs, with lunch in between sessions at one of the islands. Snorkelling is awesome, just be sure to wear sunscreen as a full day on the ocean is an easy way to get burnt.
Alon Alon, Market: The local market, Alon Alon (Slow Slow in Javanese) is the spot for some delicious fresh fish grilled over coconut husks. Here, you will find most of the village and a few friendly island cats. A great spot for a glimpse of life in Karimunjawa.
The Sunset Beaches: There’s nothing like sipping a beer and watching the sun go down. Arguably the best beaches on the island, the clear water and white sands of Pantai Ujung Gulam, Pantai Batu Topeng & Pantai Sunset are, as the name suggests, the best way to the end the day.
Kemojan: Hop on a scooter and venture up to the Northernmost tip of Karimunjawa. This is adventure territory - no guides, no recommendations. Follow the roads through the shanty towns and seaside villages. There are a few awesome beaches to discover up there as well.
Tonos: One of the best spots on the island is Tono’s beach bar, Floating Paradise. Tono has built a jetty over the most protected body of water on Karimunjawa, with 360 degree views of mountains, oceans and mangroves. We can only offer limited numbers per afternoon, but it’s a beautiful place for a beer and a swim.
Jungle Trek: Test yourself with a short, yet challenging, trek to the highest peak of Karimunjawa. Make sure to look out for monkeys as you summit the mountain, eating coconuts and planting a tree along the way. The half day tour finishes with an lunch-inclusive trip to the beach.
